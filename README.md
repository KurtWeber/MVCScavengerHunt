# MVCScavengerHunt

My son was part of an organization called the “Greater Lake County Young Marines” (http://www.glcyoungmarines.org).  At the time, he was very interested in joining the military and thought this might give him an idea of how it was like.  I made friends with the Unit staff and joined them as the Unit Adjutant soon after.  During my tenure, one of my responsibilities was to enter the recruit’s registration information into the national database.  This task was tedious and daunting because the paper work was redundant.

The parents were each given the forms or they downloaded the PDFs from the website.  They then filled out the “packet” and returned it on the first day of boot camp.  I then had to go through the dozen or so form and manually enter the information into the database doing twice the work.  Using MVC would have made this easier.  It would have made a lot more sense to have the parents fill out all registration information online where it could then be added the database automatically.

Another area where a MVC database would be helpful is in keeping track of donations.  The Young marines and recruits could send Thank You notes if the contact information was available.
